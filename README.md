# Zig Hello Scratch
An example of running a Zig application in a minimal docker image. The resulting image is based on the `scratch` image so all it contains the the application binary, in my testing it is 2.29MB in total size.

The application itself is just the hello world example generated by `zig init` with a minor modification to make the example output a bit less threatening.
